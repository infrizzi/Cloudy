# Cloudy
Universitary project for IoT course. Cloudy is an application to obtain weather forecast in a smart way.

### N.B.
The whole application is made of three parts: Arduino - Mobile Application - Server. While the first and the third ones are built in a "classical way", the mobile application, due to time constraints, is made entirely in MIT APP Inventor, an online tool for making a mobile application without any code, just blocks.
